        {`I'm`} a very positive person, always looking out for a light and
        flexible environment, good conversations, and good music. On my free
        time, I like to play guitar, watch TV shows and movies, play some games
        and, of course, to code. Be sure to check my repositories on{' '}

        I normally do things with{' '}

        ))}
        and basically, any other technology that simplifies the development
        workflow, or that adds value to the user experience.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        One of the traits I think that defines me the most, is curiosity.
        Because of it, {`I'm`} always looking for new things, pushing myself
        further, learning about new technologies, and looking for ways to do the
        things I already do, but in a better way.
